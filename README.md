### **Clinical Decision Support System**
In today's healthcare market, clinical decision support systems have undergone a rapid transition. They are now commonly managed or administered through electronic medical records and other computerised clinical workflows, which has been aided by the growing global adoption of advanced electronic medical records.

 A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is a type of software that analyses a patient's data to assist a physician in making decisions. CDS (Clinical Decision Support) is for employees, patients, and other caregivers as well as physicians and nurses. Clinical decision support systems (cdss) are computer-based applications that analyse data in electronic health records (EHRs) to give cues and reminders to help health care practitioners apply evidence-based clinical recommendations at the point of
treatment. 
Any health information technology (HIT) system, procedure, or process that aims to provide:
	The right information (evidence-based guidance, response to clinical need)
	To the right people (entire care team – including the patient)
	Through the right channels (e.g., EHR, mobile device, patient portal)
	In the right intervention formats (e.g., order sets, flow-sheets, dashboards, patient lists)
	At the right points in the workflow (for decision making or action)
Healthcare organizations are quickly trying to apply these success keys to their care processes.
According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, misdiagnoses account for 10-30% of clinical errors. A misdiagnosis can be caused by a variety of factors, ranging from supplier bias to unusual and rare illnesses. Sometimes it's as simple as the provider making a logical or judgmental error.
Misdiagnosis is a major problem since the condition cannot be adequately treated until it is accurately diagnosed. The use of clinical decision support systems can drastically minimise these sorts of mistakes, resulting in better patient outcomes.

**•	A decrease in prescription mistakes:**
      Prescription ends up being extensively more problematic while overseeing complex populaces, for instance, kids. Dosing can be jumbled to register. The grouping of equations expected to make accurate calculations make having this information available at top of the psyche particularly problematic. Clinical Decision Support gives specialists speedy admittance to dosing adding machines, drug monographs, loads, infections, and so forth This makes it fundamentally almost certain that the appropriate medication at the right piece will be given the initial time.

**•	Promptly accessible data in a single spot**
       The idea of doctors twofold checking their appraisals with the utilization of proof-based information is the same old thing. Notwithstanding, the capacity to have this data promptly accessible to a supplier and the whole consideration group dealing with a patient's case builds the proficiency of this errand. By going to CDS, clinicians can be certain that they are continuously getting predictable, d*ependable data that is pertinent to their patient. The data gave helps them in making an exact finding, all without investing a lot of energy in research.

**•	Further develop proficiency**

The undertaking of evaluating a patient, making an analysis, and settling on a treatment plan can regularly be a mind boggling one. This undertaking requires a lot of thought and, in a few especially complex cases, time. Furthermore, when botches in conclusion are made, significant time and assets are squandered.
It's assessed by the Institute of Medicine that somewhere in the range of 17 and 29 billion dollars every year is spent on erroneous or pointless consideration as the consequence of misdiagnosis. This contrarily influences the patient's wellbeing result; however, it likewise adversely influences the effectiveness of the supplier and the training's primary concern.
By using Clinical Decision Support, doctors have a more noteworthy possibility staying away from this sort of issue. The capacity to reliably twofold check themselves with quality, proof-based data radically decreases blunder. This tackles a ton of issues before they even happen.

**•	Savvy System**
       The CDSS can be savvy for wellbeing frameworks through clinical intercessions by diminishing the ongoing length of stay and decreasing test duplication. CDSS can advise the client of less expensive options in contrast to medications, or conditions that insurance agencies will cover. It could switch 91.6% of 202 medicine interviews naturally, without any blunders, expanding security, diminishing responsibility, and decreasing expense for suppliers.
By using Clinical Decision Support, doctors have a more prominent possibility staying away from this sort of issue. The capacity to reliably twofold check themselves with quality, proof-based data radically diminishes mistake. This takes care of a ton of issues before they even happen.
According to Martin Pusic, Clinicians are faced with an exponential increase in the amount of clinical data and associated medical research that continues to grow with each patient treated. Electronic medical  records and databases help physicians manage this growing trend of information, while patient-specific recommendations provided by clinical decision support systems improve decision making and ensure patient safety. You can do even more with that. Examples of different types of clinical decision support systems include diagnostic support such as **MYCIN** and **QMR**, alerts and reminders based on  **Arden syntax**, and patient management systems that use computerized representations of patient care policies. Given the evidence supporting the effectiveness of all these systems, it is important to consider decision support when designing and installing a modern health information system.
## **Purpose of CDSS**
The main purpose of CDS is to aid healthcare, to enable an analysis of patient data and using that information to help in formulating a diagnosis. A CDSS offers information to physicians and primary health care to improve the quality of care they provide their patients. A CDSS tool provides reminders, alerts, recommends care. By using CDDS you can lower your healthcare cost and improve efficiency.
However,  modern methodologies that use CDSS for support allow clinicians to interact with CDSS and use both their  knowledge and CDSS to analyze better patient data than humans or CDSS could make on their own. CDSS is usually expected to make  suggestions for review by the clinician, who will extract useful information from the results presented  and reject false CDSS suggestions. The two main types of CDSS are **knowledge base and non-knowledge base.**
## **Knowledge-based CDSS**
 Most CDSSs consist of three parts: the knowledge base, an inference engine, and a mechanism to communicate. According to Peyman et al, The knowledge base contains the rules and associations of compiled data which most often take the form of IFTHEN rules. If this was a system for determining drug interactions, then a rule might be that IF drug X is taken AND drug Y is taken THEN alert user. Using another interface, an advanced user could edit the knowledge base to keep it up to date with new drugs. The inference engine combines the rules from the knowledge base with the patient`s data. The communication mechanism allows the system to show the results to the user as well as have input into the system.
 An expression language such as **GELLO or CQL** (Clinical Quality Language) is needed for expressing knowledge artifacts in a computable manner. Example: If the patient has diabetes  and  the last hemoglobin A1c test result is less than 7%,  retesting is recommended if more than 6 months have passed, but if the last test result is 7% or more. , Re-examination is recommended. -Test if more than  3 months have passed. The current focus of the HL7 CDS WG is to build on the Clinical Quality Language (CQL).  CMS has announced the use of CQL for the eCQM specification  (https://ecqi.healthit.gov/cql).
## **Non-knowledge base CDSS**
CDSS, which does not use a knowledge base, uses a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning . This allows computers to learn from past experiences and find patterns in clinical data. This eliminates the need to create rules and provide expert opinion. However, machine learning-based systems  cannot explain the reason for the conclusion, so most clinicians do not use it directly for diagnosis for reliability and accountability reasons. Still, it may serve as a post-diagnosis system suggesting patterns that physicians can investigate further.

## **Additional areas where CDS can help:**
•	Determining drug dosing calculations 
•	Pick up drug equation guidelines 
•	Specific illness can be treated by using severity indexes 
•	Alerts templates or order sets for specific diseases 
•	Analyze reportable precondition on the basis on EHR inputs 
•	Timetriggered reminders are used for medication delivery                              and dosage changes 
•	Analyzing filtered information or education material
## **Conclusion**
CDS tools are increasingly using artificial intelligence and machine learning to support advanced analytics. Machine learning algorithms can consume large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and provide users with detailed results. The basic idea behind a clinical decision support system is to help doctors and staff in the same way that an enterprise support system helps business professionals make business decisions. Alternatively, clinical decision support systems can be viewed as a better patient experience and a better health outcome.
